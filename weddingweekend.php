                            <li>Since you’ll be traveling internationally, you’ll need a valid passport. If you don’t have one you can apply for one <a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/passports/apply.html">here</a>.</li>
                            <li>Book a flight that arrives in Cancun no later than 9:00pm so you’ll have time to travel to Isla Mujeres after you land, otherwise you’ll have to spend the first night in Cancun. Also, book a flight that departs from Cancun no earlier than 9:00am so you’ll have time to travel from Isla Mujeres to the Cancun airport on the same morning.</li>
                            <li>On the plane the flight attendant will give you two cards to fill out, a Mexican Tourist Card (FTM) and the Customs form. Present the tourist card at immigration with your passport and they will stamp your passport and return half of the form, keep this as you’ll need it when you exit the country. If you lose it, they may charge you a fine. Beware, the immigration process can be long. Then pick up any checked luggage and head to customs. At customs, you will press a button, if it is green, your bags won’t be searched, if it’s red, they will, then you present them with your customs card.</li>
