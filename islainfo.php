                <h2>About Isla Mujeres</h2>
                <p>Isla Mujeres, which is Spanish for "Island of Women", is a small island in the Mexican Caribbean Sea, located eight miles off of the eastern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula near Cancun Mexico. 
                <p>In Pre-Columbian times the island was sacred to the Maya goddess of childbirth and medicine, Ix Chel. When the Spanish arrived in the 16th century they named it "Isla Mujeres" because of the many images of goddesses.

                <p>We recommend taking pesos from ATMs to use during your trip with your American bank card as the rates are generally better than trying to exchange US dollars or travelers' checks. There are ATMs on Isla at the bank, 7-11, and the Express grocery store. The bank and 7-11 are directly across the street from the dock when you arrive.
                <p>You can also use the ATM inside the convenience store at Puerto Juerez in Cancun before you board the ferry to Isla.

                <p><strong>By Taxi</strong> - You can flag a taxi down when you see them drive past. Sometimes taxis will pick you up when they already have others in the car.

                </ul>
                <p><strong>By Golf Cart</strong> – Golf carts can be rented and are a super fun way to get around the island. They are normally rented for a day (8 hours), 24 hours or multiple days. <!-- A few companies that rent golf carts are: -->

                <h2>Tipping</h2>
                <p>Bring a few single American dollars to use for tips on your way to Isla. The standard tip for restaurants and tours is 15%. Taxis don't expect tips unless they help you with your bags.

                <p>Don’t drink the water. It’s not safe to drink. Buy bottled water or drink the bottled water provided at the hotel. We recommend brushing your teeth with bottled water as well. Ice is safe to drink. The food across the island should be safe to eat. We ate at several little local restaurants as well as several street food stands without any trouble when we visited. However, please use your best judgment.

                <p>Isla is very safe. There aren't any "bad" parts of the island, so feel free to explore, but keep your wits about you and again use your best judgment. The buddy system is recommended after dark.

                <p>Located on the north end of the island a short walk from the Playa Media Luna Hotel. The most popular public beach on Isla. The sea is calm here and the beach is shallow – you can walk 25 feet out and still be in waist deep water. Most establishments charge for chair and umbrella rentals, but you can lie down a towel anywhere. Great for watching the sunset. It is a top-optional beach.
